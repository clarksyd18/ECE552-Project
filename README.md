## Spring 2022
### About
Project was to implement a pipelined MIPS processor with 2-way set associative D-cache and I-cache using Verilog.
### About Class
CS/ECE552-Introduction to Computer Architecture 
Followed David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy's Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware Software Interface,SIXTH (MIPS) Edition.
This corse taught how to completely design a correct single processor computer, including processor datapath, instruction set design and addressing, processor control structures and microprogramming, memory systems, caches and memory hierarchies, and interrupts and I/O structures
